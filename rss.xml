            <description><![CDATA[<p>Rich goat curry You’ll need to marinate the goat meat for at least an hour before cooking. Serves 4 500g boneless goat meat, diced 4 tsp rapeseed oil 4 red onions, peeled and each cut into 4 pieces 4 tomatoes, finely chopped 500ml hot water (add more if required) 4 potatoes, boiled, cooled and chopped into large pieces 1 tsp dried pomegranate seeds A bunch of coriander leaves, chopped For the marinade 100g natural yoghurt 2 tsp fresh ginger, grated 2 tsp garlic, grated ½ tsp turmeric powder 4 tsp tomato puree 1 tsp garam masala 4 tsp red Kashmiri chilli paste Salt, to taste 1 First, make the marinade. Whisk the yoghurt, ginger and garlic, then add the turmeric, tomato puree, garam masala, red chilli paste and a pinch of salt. Mix well, add the goat meat, ensuring it is thoroughly coated, then set aside. 2 Heat the oil in a pan. Add the big chunks of onion and fry for 5-6 minutes on a high heat, until golden brown. Add the tomatoes and cook for another couple of minutes. 3 Add the marinated meat and turn the heat up high. Keep stirring until the mixture is dry – this will take around 8-10 minutes. 4 Add the water and cook on a low heat, covering the pan with a lid, for 30 minutes. Add the cooked potatoes and pomegranate seeds. Cook for a further 30 minutes until the meat is cooked, but keep stirring occasionally. Garnish with the fresh coriander, and serve.</p>]]></description>
